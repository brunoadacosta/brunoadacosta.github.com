title: Welcome to my new blog
---

I was started blogging on my [another domain](http://rollingwithcode.blogspot.com), but time passed, and I stopped some time ago. Sometimes a new subject comes to write something, and I made some drafts, but I didn't like my old blog, I can't change the layout as I want, I can't freely-edit my articles, and I tried to build my own solution, but I didn't like that too.

When [Vincius Quaiato](http://twitter.com/vquaiato) talked about rewrite your own blog, I suggested to use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I was looking to jekyll for a while, but never really used it. He wrote [his blog](http://vquaiato.com) and the result seems nice, better than the previous, and now he has full control on your blog, that's what I'm looking for.

And after a long while, I want to start my blog again. This blog is the new one, I wrote the css, I wrote the html, and now I have full control.

After all, I want to thanks to [Adriano Tadao](http://twitter.com/adrianotadao), [Mauricio Ferreira](http://twitter.com/manfe01), [Mauricio Rodriges](http://twitter.com/mauricilis), [Su√©len Balbinot](http://twitter.com/Su_Balbinot) and [Tanira Maurer](http://twitter.com/taniramaurer) the ones who gave feedback when I was building this blog, and this final result is mostly because of them (If you did not like this blog, you can send a message to them :trollface:).

The old posts will not be moved to this one, but will still available at the blogspot. And now I'll write some posts to put them here.

See you soon.
